# Changelog

All notable changes to FluxGuard are documented here.

FluxGuard is pre-1.0; minor versions may change behavior. Behavior changes are called out explicitly.

## 0.12.0

### Changed — behavior

- **`FailMode` now derives from `GuardPreset` when it is not set explicitly.**
  `GuardPreset.Strict` resolves to `FailMode.Closed`; `Minimal` and `Standard` keep `FailMode.Open`.

  Choosing `Strict` states "security over availability", but until now a consumer who picked it
  and did not also call `WithFailMode(FailMode.Closed)` still got fail-open: a guard that threw was
  logged and skipped, and the request passed **without that guard's verdict**.

  **Who is affected:** consumers on `GuardPreset.Strict` that never set `FailMode`. For them a
  guard execution error now blocks the request instead of passing it. This is
  breaking-adjacent — the API is unchanged, the behavior is not.

  **Unaffected:** `Minimal`/`Standard` consumers, and anyone who sets `FailMode` explicitly.
  An explicit assignment always wins, in either direction and whatever order it is set in:

  ```csharp
  // Strict, but availability first — unchanged behavior
  FluxGuard.Create(b => b.WithPreset(GuardPreset.Strict).WithFailMode(FailMode.Open));
  ```

  `FluxGuardOptions.FailMode` keeps its `FailMode` (non-nullable) signature, so this is not a
  source or binary break.

### Documentation

- README "Fail Mode" section documents the preset resolution table and the override rule.
- `GuardPreset.Strict` and `FluxGuardOptions.FailMode` XML docs state the linkage.

## 0.11.2

- Guard regex match timeout raised to 1s as a hard upper bound; documented that bundled patterns
  are backtracking-safe, so hitting the timeout indicates extreme input size or host contention.
- README and XML doc security note on the fail-open default.
